# OpenSCAD Preview

Vim plugin to automatically open OpenSCAD when editing files. 

By default the scad file is opened as is. Windows can be opened for specific modules by commenting `\\ PREVIEW` above the module. A temporary file will be created that uses the main script and calls that module only.
