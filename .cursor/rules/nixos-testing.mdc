# NixOS Configuration Testing
priority: 2

This rule helps ensure that NixOS configuration changes are valid before applying them to the system.

## Key Files
The main NixOS configuration is in [common/configuration.nix](mdc:common/configuration.nix).

## Testing Process
When changes are made to any `.nix` files in the repository:
1. The rule will trigger automatically after formatting is complete
2. `nh os build` will be run to build the configuration
3. Build errors will be displayed if any issues are found
4. The build will not affect the running system

## Command Details
- Command: `nh os build`
- Trigger: On any `.nix` file changes or creation
- Excludes: `result` directory from builds
- Uses nix-output-monitor for better formatting
- Runs after formatting due to priority: 2

## Important Notes
- This is a build-only operation that won't modify your system
- The build may take several minutes depending on changes
- If the build fails, review the error messages before proceeding
